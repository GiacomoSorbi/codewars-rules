Language specific remarks
=========================

While the previous section included general tips, it's often not obvious how to
implement them in a test framework. Random strings? Random numbers? How does one
create specific elements?

This section gives some insights on those topics. However, it __cannot__ replace
your language's test framework documentation. You need to have at least some
grasp of that one. Otherwise this section will probably confuse you.
