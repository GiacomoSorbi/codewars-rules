## CSharp
CSharp is the only language that doesn't have a proper documentation on Codewars
currently. This will probably change at some point. The test framework is
[NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/), initially a port from JUnit. It's rather large,
so we cannot cover [everything][Nunit doc] here, but at least some points
should be addressed.

*Note:* C# looks rather ugly in the generated PDF, so I'm going to refer to it
as _CSharp_ instead.
