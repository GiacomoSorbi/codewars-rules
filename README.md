[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bkaes/codewars-rules.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bkaes/codewars-rules) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/bkaes/codewars-rules](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/bkaes/codewars-rules?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) 

These documents contains some rules I've employed for my katas and my translation on [Codewars]. Some of them are very simple (e.g same arguments, same order), others are sometimes really hard to fulfill (random tests). But only rules aren't interesting. This document contains also some tips, so that you (or I) can implement them.

If you find an error, have a better idea, or think that all of this is a pile of unicorn misery, feel free to create an issue or a pull-request. Have a look at the LICENCE.
